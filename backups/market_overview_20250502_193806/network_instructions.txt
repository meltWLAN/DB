# GitHub Upload Instructions

Due to network connectivity issues, we were unable to push your changes to GitHub directly. Here's what to do when your network connection is restored:

## Option 1: Push from your current branch

1. Make sure you're on the market-overview-enhancement branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout market-overview-enhancement
   ```

2. Push your changes:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin market-overview-enhancement
   ```

3. Create a pull request on GitHub to merge your changes into the main branch.

## Option 2: Apply the patch file

1. In the event your local changes get lost, you can apply the patch file that's included in this backup:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git apply backups/market_overview_20250502_193806/0001-Fix-market-overview-module-repair-with_cache-decorat.patch
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix market overview module: repair with_cache decorator and ensure real data usage"
   git push origin main
   ```

## Option 3: Push the tag

The tag v1.2.0 was created to mark this version:
```bash
git push origin v1.2.0
```

## What was accomplished

1. Fixed the `with_cache` decorator in the DataSourceManager class to properly handle method caching
2. Updated the market overview module to use real data from API instead of simulated data
3. Added analysis methods for market trends, industry strength, market sentiment, and future hot sector prediction
4. Resolved merge conflicts in the files

The most important changes were made to:
- src/enhanced/data/fetchers/data_source_manager.py
- gui_controller.py 
- stock_analysis_gui.py

A complete backup of these files is included in this directory.
